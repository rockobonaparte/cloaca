Some priorities:

1. Cloaca should not escape exceptions with a crash. Print and exit without causing a report to Microsoft
2. Double check recursion
   1. Basic recursion
   2. Defining a recursing function inside another function
3. Implement multiplication on arrays to create extended versions of them. This accounts for a lot of errors too.
4. Implement array subscripting. I don't support array subscripting yet! Whoops!
5. Enable sherlock2 
6. Need to actually implement NotImplementedError, which is ironic!
7. Revisit from there

Also need to implemented:
* sorted
* min
* max
