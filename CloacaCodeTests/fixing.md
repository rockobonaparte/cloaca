Some priorities:

1. Cloaca should not escape exceptions with a crash. Print and exit without causing a report to Microsoft
2. Double check recursion
   1. Basic recursion
   2. Defining a recursing function inside another function
3. Enable sherlock2
4. Need to actually implement NotImplementedError, which is ironic!
5. Revisit from there
