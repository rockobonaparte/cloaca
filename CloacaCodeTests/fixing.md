Some priorities:

1. [DONE] Cloaca should not escape exceptions with a crash. Print and exit without causing a report to Microsoft
2. [DONE] Double check recursion
   1. [DONE] Basic recursion
   2. [DONE] Defining a recursing function inside another function
3. [DONE] Implement multiplication on arrays to create extended versions of them. This accounts for a lot of errors too.
4. [DONE] Implement array slicing. I don't support array slicing yet! Whoops!
5. [DONE] Enable sherlock2 
6. [DONE] Need to actually implement NotImplementedError, which is ironic!
7. [DONE] Implement list add
8. [DONE enough] Implement min
9. [DONE enough] Implement max
10. Implement sorted()
12. Double check that we can index into strings
12. Implement find() for strings
11. Rerun tests and refile this list
